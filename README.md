# Design Patterns - Facade

This repository showcases an implementation of the Facade design pattern in C#. The code demonstrates how to provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, allowing clients to access functionality without interacting directly with the subsystem's components. This pattern is useful for reducing the complexity of client code and improving code maintainability.

## Introduction
The Facade design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It hides the complexities of the subsystem and makes the subsystem easier to use for the client. The pattern is beneficial for simplifying client interaction with complex systems and promoting loose coupling.

## Implementation Overview
This repository provides a C# implementation of the Facade design pattern. Key components of the code include:

- **SubsystemA, SubsystemB, SubsystemC Classes**: These classes represent individual components of the subsystem with specific operations.
- **Facade Class**: Provides a simplified method (`SimplifiedOperation()`) that interacts with the subsystems and exposes an easy-to-use interface to the client.
- **Program Class**: Demonstrates how the client can use the `Facade` class to access the subsystem without directly interacting with its components.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MansourJouya/DesignPattern-Facade.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd DesignPattern-Facade
```

Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment to explore the implementation.

## Usage
1. Open the solution file (.sln) in your C# development environment.
2. Run the `Program` class to see the Facade pattern in action.
3. Modify the `Facade` class or the `Main()` method to customize the demonstration or add other subsystems.
